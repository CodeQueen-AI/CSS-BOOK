# 🎨 CSS Filters Demo – Blur, Brightness, Contrast

This project demonstrates the use of **CSS filter functions** like `blur()`, `brightness()`, and `contrast()` to visually enhance images using only HTML + CSS.

## 🌟 What Are CSS Filters?

CSS Filters are functions that allow you to apply **visual effects** like blurring, lighting, or color manipulation directly to HTML elements — especially images, backgrounds, and divs.

## 🖼️ Filters Used in This Project

| Filter         | Description                              | Example Value     |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `blur()`       | Adds a soft blur effect                  | `blur(4px)`       |
| `brightness()` | Increases or decreases brightness         | `brightness(1.4)` |

Each filter is applied to a different image using a simple CSS class.
