# 🌈 Responsive Typography using CSS `clamp()`

This simple HTML project demonstrates **fluid, responsive font sizes** using the powerful CSS `clamp()` function.  
It allows text to automatically resize across different screen sizes — **no media queries needed**! 📱💻🖥️

---

## 📌 What This Project Does

- Uses the `clamp()` function to make headings and paragraphs fluid (responsive).
- Adjusts font size smoothly based on screen width.
- Avoids hardcoded sizes or multiple breakpoints.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### ✅ `clamp(min, preferred, max)`

- `min`: The smallest size allowed.
- `preferred`: The ideal size that changes with screen width (like `vw`).
- `max`: The largest size allowed.

### 🧪 Example:
```css
font-size: clamp(16px, 2.5vw, 22px);
````

➡️ This means:

* Font will never be smaller than `16px`
* Will grow based on `2.5%` of screen width
* But won’t go bigger than `22px`
