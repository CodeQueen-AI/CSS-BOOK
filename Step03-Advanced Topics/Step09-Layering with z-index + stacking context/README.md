# 🧱 CSS Layering with `z-index` & Stacking Context

This project visually demonstrates how CSS layering works using the `z-index` property and how **stacking context** affects element positioning on the z-axis.

Perfect for learning how elements overlap in web layouts!

---

## 📚 What Is `z-index`?

The `z-index` property in CSS controls the **stacking order** of overlapping elements.

- Higher `z-index` = appears **on top**
- Works only on elements with `position` set (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`)

---

## 🧠 What Is a Stacking Context?

A **stacking context** is a new "layer" in which child elements are stacked independently of the global stack.

It is created when an element has:

- `position` + `z-index`
- `transform`, `filter`, `opacity < 1`, `will-change`, etc.

Children inside a stacking context respect the stacking order **within** that context — **not outside** of it.

## 🧪 Example Overview

| Element            | `z-index` | Appears On Top? |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------|
| 🔴 Red Box          | 1         | Bottom layer     |
| 🟢 Green Box        | 2         | Middle layer     |
| 🔵 Blue Box         | 3         | Top layer        |
| ⚫ Gray Box (Context)| 5         | Top of all       |
| 🟡 Gold Box (Child) | 1 (inside context) | Appears behind gray even with low z-index |

## 🧩 Key CSS Used

```css
.box {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 2;
}

.stacking-context {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 5;
  transform: scale(1); /* Creates new stacking context */
}
````

## 📱 How to Run

1. Save the code as `index.html`
2. Open it in any modern browser
3. Observe which boxes overlap others based on their z-index

## 💡 Next Level Ideas

* Add `hover` to change `z-index` dynamically
* Simulate tooltips & modals
* Explore `opacity`, `transform`, `mix-blend-mode` to trigger stacking contexts
