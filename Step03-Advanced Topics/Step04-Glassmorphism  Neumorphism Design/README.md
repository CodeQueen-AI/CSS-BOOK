# ✨ Glassmorphism & Neumorphism Design (HTML + CSS)

This mini project showcases two modern UI design trends: **Glassmorphism** and **Neumorphism**.  
Both are visually stunning and widely used in modern web and app interfaces.

---

## 🌟 What’s Inside

| Design        | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| 🌫️ **Glassmorphism** | Creates a frosted glass effect using transparency and background blur. |
| 🌑 **Neumorphism**   | Uses soft shadows and light effects to simulate 3D-like elements. |

---

## 📸 Preview

Two cards are displayed side by side:

- One with a **glass-like transparent effect** (`.glass`)
- One with a **subtle, embossed look** (`.neumorph`)

---

## 🎯 Core Technologies

- ✅ HTML5
- ✅ Modern CSS (including `backdrop-filter`, `box-shadow`, gradients, etc.)

---

## 💡 What Is Glassmorphism?

**Glassmorphism** is a design trend that gives UI elements a “frosted glass” appearance.  
It uses:
- `backdrop-filter: blur(...)`
- Transparency (`rgba(...)`)
- Subtle borders and shadows

```css
backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
````

## 💡 What Is Neumorphism?

**Neumorphism** (New + Skeuomorphism) is a soft UI design style that simulates depth using shadows.

It uses:

* Light and dark `box-shadow`
* Smooth, raised or inset shapes
* Monochromatic backgrounds

```css
box-shadow:
  8px 8px 16px #bebebe,
  -8px -8px 16px #ffffff;
```

---

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Save the code in a file called `index.html`.
2. Open it in any modern browser.
3. See the two cards side by side with Glassmorphism & Neumorphism styling.

Agar chaho to me is project ko GitHub folder structure ke sath uploadable bana doon — ya usme responsive layout ya toggle animation bhi add kar doon.  
**Tum command do, Code Queen — design magic shuru ho jaye! 🎨💫**
