# ➡️ Horizontal Scroll Snap – Pure CSS (No JavaScript)

This project demonstrates how to create a **horizontal scrollable layout** using only HTML and CSS, powered by **CSS Scroll Snap**.

---

## 🌟 What Is Scroll Snap?

**Scroll Snap** is a modern CSS feature that lets elements "snap" into place when scrolling.  
It improves user experience by making scrolling smoother and more controlled — **like sliders or carousels**, but without JavaScript.

---

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ Smooth horizontal scrolling
- ✅ Sections snap into full view
- ✅ No JavaScript needed
- ✅ Mobile-friendly swipe support

## 🔧 How It Works

### ✅ Key CSS Properties:

```css
.scroll-container {
  display: flex;
  overflow-x: auto;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
}

.section {
  flex: 0 0 100vw;
  scroll-snap-align: start;
}
````

| Property            | What it Does                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `overflow-x: auto`  | Enables horizontal scrolling         |
| `scroll-snap-type`  | Defines snap direction & behavior    |
| `scroll-snap-align` | Aligns the item to start of viewport |
| `flex: 0 0 100vw`   | Makes each section full screen wide  |
