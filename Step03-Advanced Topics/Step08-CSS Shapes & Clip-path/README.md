# ✨ CSS Shapes & `clip-path` Demo

This project showcases how to create **unique shapes in CSS** using the powerful `clip-path` property — including circles, triangles, stars, rhombuses, and even organic blobs!

---

## 🎯 What Is `clip-path`?

The `clip-path` CSS property lets you clip (cut) an element into a **custom shape**.  
It hides the parts of the element that fall outside the path or polygon you define.

---

## 🌟 Shapes Used in This Demo

| Shape    | Clip Path Syntax |
|----------|------------------|
| ✅ Circle     | `clip-path: circle(50%)` |
| 🔺 Triangle   | `clip-path: polygon(...)` |
| 🔷 Rhombus    | `clip-path: polygon(...)` |
| ⭐ Star       | `clip-path: polygon(...)` |
| 🧬 Blob       | `clip-path: path("...")` (SVG path) |

All shapes use a **gradient background**, **box shadows**, and are fully **responsive-friendly**.

---

## 🧪 Sample Code

```css
.shape {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #009688, #4caf50);
  clip-path: polygon(...); /* shape-specific */
}
