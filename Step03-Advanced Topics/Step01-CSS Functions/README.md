# 🎨 CSS Functions Example – `var()`, `calc()`, `clamp()`

This simple HTML + CSS project demonstrates how to use three powerful CSS functions: `var()`, `calc()`, and `clamp()` – all in one page.

---

## 📌 What This Project Shows

It includes:
- A colored container with padding and responsive text.
- A resizable box whose height is calculated based on viewport size.
- Usage of CSS variables for maintainable and clean code.

---

## 🧠 What Are These Functions?

### ✅ `var()`
**Use:** Reuse CSS variables across your styles.  
**Why:** Makes code cleaner and easier to update.  
**When to Use:** When you want consistent colors, padding, fonts, etc.

```css
--main-color: #009688;
color: var(--main-color);
````

### ✅ `calc()`

**Use:** Do math in CSS (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
**Why:** Helps create layouts that are flexible and dynamic.
**When to Use:** When you want to mix units like %, px, em.

```css
width: calc(100% - 50px);
```

---

### ✅ `clamp()`

**Use:** Create responsive values that stay within a defined range.
**Why:** It gives you more control over responsiveness.
**When to Use:** For font sizes, padding, widths that adjust with screen size but never get too small or too large.

```css
font-size: clamp(16px, 2vw, 24px);
```
