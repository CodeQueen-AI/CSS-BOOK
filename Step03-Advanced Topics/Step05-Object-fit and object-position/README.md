# 🖼️ CSS `object-fit` & `object-position` Demo

This project demonstrates the use of CSS properties `object-fit` and `object-position` to control how images behave inside containers.  
These properties are especially useful for creating responsive image layouts like cards, galleries, or profile pictures.

---

## 🎯 What Is `object-fit`?

The `object-fit` property specifies how the content (like an `<img>` or `<video>`) should resize to fit its container.

### 🧪 Values Used:

| Value     | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `cover`   | Image fills the container and crops if needed |
| `contain` | Image fits completely without cropping |
| `fill`    | Image stretches to fill the container |
| `none`    | Image remains in original size |

---

## 🎯 What Is `object-position`?

The `object-position` property controls **how the image is aligned** inside the container.  
It works with `object-fit: cover` or `contain`.

### 🧪 Examples:

- `object-position: top left`
- `object-position: bottom right`
